# URL shortener written in Go

This is a simple URL shortener written in Go. It uses Redis as the DB and the web framework Gin.

## Why?

I'm learning Go and I wanted to build something simple to get started. I want to keep adding features to this project as I learn more about Go and make it a more complete project.

## How to run

**Note:** This is very much a work in progress. I'm still learning Go and I'm sure there are better ways to do things and it will be improving along the way.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Redis
- Reflex (optional) - This is used to auto reload the server when a file changes. You can install it with

```bash
  go install github.com/cespare/reflex
```

### Steps

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `go get` to install dependencies
3. Install and run Redis on port `6379`
4. Run `go run main.go`
5. Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser

## Usage

At the moment there are 3 endpoints:

### GET `/`

This is to confirm the up status of the service. It will return a simple JSON response with the status code and a message.

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Up and running!"
}
```

### POST `/create-short-url`

This is the endpoint to create a new short URL. It takes a JSON body with the URL to shorten and a userId. It will return a JSON response with the shortened URL.

**request**

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.google.com",
  "userId": "123"
}
```

**response**

```json
{
  "shortUrl": "http://localhost:8080/<RANDOM-HASH>"
}
```

### GET `/:<RANDOM-HASH>`

This is the endpoint to redirect to the original URL. It will redirect to the original URL if it exists in the DB.
